                        <p>Loose chalk is good to have if you get sweaty hands because it dries your hands up.</p>
                        <p>Even if you don't suffer from sweaty hands it's still good because it does provide extra grip.</p>

                        <p>Chalk bags are good because it gives you a smaller bag to hold your chalk so you don't have a massive bag.</p>
                        <p>You can also get straps for chalk bags so they can go around your waist so you can have it on you when climbing.</p>
                        <p>Click on the picture and it'll take you to amazon where you can have a look at some chalk bags.</p>

                        <p>A climbing brush is useful because too much chalk build-up on rocks can make it less grip so you use the brush to scrub on it to get the build-up off.</p>
