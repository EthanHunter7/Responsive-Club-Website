                <h4>Hello we are the Newcastle Bouldering Club</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <h5>What we are doing</h5>
                <p>We are a group put together to give other people the place to find people to go climbing with if they don't have some one them selfs. Also to give people a place to find where they can go to do climbing as a hobby.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <h5>Why we are doing it</h5>
                <p>This club is non-profitable. So we don't earn money for anything we are doing. We are simply looking to help people and make it easy for everyone interested in indoor bouldering to find people and places they can do it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <h5>How we decided to do this</h5>
                <p> We are all bouldering enthusiasts and we found each other through climbing and became friends. We were all once alone doing it and it took time finding each other. So we got the idea to try and make it easier for people to connect to others so you can enjoy bouldering together.</p>
